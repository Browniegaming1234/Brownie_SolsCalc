# Sol's RNG Calculator
## Created by Brownie!
Sol's RNG Calculator helps you estimate how many rolls it would take to obtain a specific aura in Sol's RNG, based on your current luck. Just input your luck and desired aura to see your odds and roll count!

# How to use it!
## If you didn't understand from the title, that's okay!
### Don't worry if you're not sure— I'm here to help!
First, find your current luck stat — you can see it on the leaderboard in the main island.
Once you have your luck value, enter it into the text field. When you press calculate, the tool will estimate how many rolls you might need to get that aura!

*If there are any issues, please report them in the issues tab!*

*This calculator is a work in progress. Please bear with me as I continue to fix issues and add more auras in response to updates, as i'm also trying to fix a ton of issues currently!*
### Thanks for using Sol's RNG Calculator by Brownie!
### Lastly enjoy!
