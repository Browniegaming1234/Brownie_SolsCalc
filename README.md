# Sol's RNG Calculator
## Created by Brownie!
Sol's RNG Calculator helps you estimate how many rolls it would take to obtain a specific aura in Sol's RNG, based on your current luck. Just input your luck and desired aura to see your odds and roll count!

*This calculator is a work in progress. Please bear with me as I continue to fix issues and add more auras in response to updates, as i'm also trying to fix a ton of issues currently!*
